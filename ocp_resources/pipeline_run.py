            params (list[Any]): Params is a list of parameter names and values.

            pipeline_ref (dict[str, Any]): PipelineRef can be used to refer to a specific instance of a Pipeline.

            pipeline_spec (Any): Specifying PipelineSpec can be disabled by setting `disable-inline-
              spec` feature flag. See Pipeline.spec (API version: tekton.dev/v1)

            task_run_specs (list[Any]): TaskRunSpecs holds a set of runtime specs

            task_run_template (dict[str, Any]): TaskRunTemplate represent template of taskrun

            workspaces (list[Any]): Workspaces holds a set of workspace bindings that must match names
