        Args:
            additional_cors_allowed_origins(List[Any]): additionalCORSAllowedOrigins lists additional, user-defined regular
              expressions describing hosts for which the API server allows
              access using the CORS headers. This may be needed to access the
              API and the integrated OAuth server from JavaScript applications.
              The values are regular expressions that correspond to the Golang
              regular expression language.

            audit(Dict[str, Any]): audit specifies the settings for audit configuration to be applied to
              all OpenShift-provided API servers in the cluster.

            client_ca(Dict[str, Any]): clientCA references a ConfigMap containing a certificate bundle for
              the signers that will be recognized for incoming client
              certificates in addition to the operator managed signers. If this
              is empty, then only operator managed signers are valid. You
              usually only have to set this if you have your own PKI you wish to
              honor client certificates from. The ConfigMap must exist in the
              openshift-config namespace and contain the following required
              fields: - ConfigMap.Data["ca-bundle.crt"] - CA bundle.

            encryption(Dict[str, Any]): encryption allows the configuration of encryption of resources at the
              datastore layer.

            serving_certs(Dict[str, Any]): servingCert is the TLS cert info for serving secure traffic. If not
              specified, operator managed certificates will be used for serving
              secure traffic.

            tls_security_profile(Dict[str, Any]): tlsSecurityProfile specifies settings for TLS connections for
              externally exposed servers.   If unset, a default (which may
              change between releases) is chosen. Note that only Old,
              Intermediate and Custom profiles are currently supported, and the
              maximum available minTLSVersion is VersionTLS12.
