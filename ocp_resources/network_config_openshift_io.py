        Args:
            cluster_network (list[Any]): IP address pool to use for pod IPs. This field is immutable after
              installation.

            external_ip (dict[str, Any]): externalIP defines configuration for controllers that affect
              Service.ExternalIP. If nil, then ExternalIP is not allowed to be
              set.

            network_diagnostics (dict[str, Any]): networkDiagnostics defines network diagnostics configuration.  Takes
              precedence over spec.disableNetworkDiagnostics in
              network.operator.openshift.io. If networkDiagnostics is not
              specified or is empty, and the spec.disableNetworkDiagnostics flag
              in network.operator.openshift.io is set to true, the network
              diagnostics feature will be disabled.

            network_type (str): networkType is the plugin that is to be deployed (e.g. OVNKubernetes).
              This should match a value that the cluster-network-operator
              understands, or else no networking will be installed. Currently
              supported values are: - OVNKubernetes This field is immutable
              after installation.

            service_network (list[Any]): IP address pool for services. Currently, we only support a single
              entry here. This field is immutable after installation.

            service_node_port_range (str): The port range allowed for Services of type NodePort. If not
              specified, the default of 30000-32767 will be used. Such Services
              without a NodePort specified will have one automatically allocated
              from this range. This parameter can be updated after the cluster
              is installed.
