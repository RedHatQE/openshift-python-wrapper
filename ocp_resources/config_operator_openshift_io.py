        Args:
            log_level (str): logLevel is an intent based logging for an overall component.  It does
              not give fine grained control, but it is a simple way to manage
              coarse grained logging choices that operators have to interpret
              for their operands.  Valid values are: "Normal", "Debug", "Trace",
              "TraceAll". Defaults to "Normal".

            management_state (str): managementState indicates whether and how the operator should manage
              the component

            observed_config (dict[str, Any]): observedConfig holds a sparse config that controller has observed from
              the cluster state.  It exists in spec because it is an input to
              the level for the operator

            operator_log_level (str): operatorLogLevel is an intent based logging for the operator itself.
              It does not give fine grained control, but it is a simple way to
              manage coarse grained logging choices that operators have to
              interpret for themselves.  Valid values are: "Normal", "Debug",
              "Trace", "TraceAll". Defaults to "Normal".

            unsupported_config_overrides (dict[str, Any]): unsupportedConfigOverrides overrides the final configuration that was
              computed by the operator. Red Hat does not support the use of this
              field. Misuse of this field could lead to unexpected behavior or
              conflict with other configuration options. Seek guidance from the
              Red Hat support before using this field. Use of this property
              blocks cluster upgrades, it must be removed before upgrading your
              cluster.
