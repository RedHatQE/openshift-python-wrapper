This field may only be set for init containers, and the only allowed\n        value is "Always". For non-init containers or when this field is not\n        specified, the restart behavior is defined by the Pod\'s restart policy and\n        the container type. Setting the RestartPolicy as "Always" for the init\n        container will have the following effect: this init container will be\n        continually restarted on exit until all regular containers have terminated.\n        Once all regular containers have completed, all init containers with\n        restartPolicy "Always" will be shut down. This lifecycle differs from normal\n        init containers and is often referred to as a "sidecar" container. Although\n        this init container still starts in the init container sequence, it does not\n        wait for the container to complete before proceeding to the next init\n        container. Instead, the next init container starts immediately after this\n        init container is started, or after any startupProbe has successfully\n        completed.\n        \n      securityContext\t<SecurityContext>\n        SecurityContext defines the security options the container should be run\n        with. If set, the fields of SecurityContext override the equivalent fields\n        of PodSecurityContext. More info:\n        https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/security-context/\n        \n      startupProbe\t<Probe>\n        StartupProbe indicates that the Pod has successfully initialized. If\n        specified, no other probes are executed until this completes successfully.\n        If this probe fails, the Pod will be restarted, just as if the livenessProbe\n        failed. This can be used to provide different probe parameters at the\n        beginning of a Pod\'s lifecycle, when it might take a long time to load data\n        or warm a cache, than during steady-state operation. This cannot be updated.\n        More info:\n        https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-lifecycle#container-probes\n        \n      stdin\t<boolean>\n        Whether this container should allocate a buffer for stdin in the container\n        runtime.

Default is false.\n        \n      stdinOnce\t<boolean>\n        Whether the container runtime should close the stdin channel after it has\n        been opened by a single attach. When stdin is true the stdin stream will\n        remain open across multiple attach sessions. If stdinOnce is set to true,\n        stdin is opened on container start, is empty until the first client attaches\n        to stdin, and then remains open and accepts data until the client\n        disconnects, at which time stdin is closed and remains closed until the\n        container is restarted. If this flag is false, a container processes that\n        reads from stdin will never receive an EOF. Default is false\n        \n      terminationMessagePath\t<string>\n        Optional: Path at which the file to which the container\'s termination\n        message will be written is mounted into the container\'s filesystem. Message\n        written is intended to be brief final status, such as an assertion failure\n        message. Will be truncated by the node if greater than 4096 bytes.

Cannot be updated.\n        \n      terminationMessagePolicy\t<string>\n        Indicate how the termination message should be populated.

FallbackToLogsOnError will use the last chunk\n        of container log output if the termination message file is empty and the\n        container exited with an error.

This field may only be set for init containers, and the only allowed\n        value is "Always". For non-init containers or when this field is not\n        specified, the restart behavior is defined by the Pod\'s restart policy and\n        the container type. Setting the RestartPolicy as "Always" for the init\n        container will have the following effect: this init container will be\n        continually restarted on exit until all regular containers have terminated.\n        Once all regular containers have completed, all init containers with\n        restartPolicy "Always" will be shut down. This lifecycle differs from normal\n        init containers and is often referred to as a "sidecar" container. Although\n        this init container still starts in the init container sequence, it does not\n        wait for the container to complete before proceeding to the next init\n        container. Instead, the next init container starts immediately after this\n        init container is started, or after any startupProbe has successfully\n        completed.\n        \n      securityContext\t<SecurityContext>\n        SecurityContext defines the security options the container should be run\n        with. If set, the fields of SecurityContext override the equivalent fields\n        of PodSecurityContext. More info:\n        https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/security-context/\n        \n      startupProbe\t<Probe>\n        StartupProbe indicates that the Pod has successfully initialized. If\n        specified, no other probes are executed until this completes successfully.\n        If this probe fails, the Pod will be restarted, just as if the livenessProbe\n        failed. This can be used to provide different probe parameters at the\n        beginning of a Pod\'s lifecycle, when it might take a long time to load data\n        or warm a cache, than during steady-state operation.

If this is not set, reads from stdin in the container will always\n        result in EOF. Default is false.\n        \n      stdinOnce\t<boolean>\n        Whether the container runtime should close the stdin channel after it has\n        been opened by a single attach. When stdin is true the stdin stream will\n        remain open across multiple attach sessions. If stdinOnce is set to true,\n        stdin is opened on container start, is empty until the first client attaches\n        to stdin, and then remains open and accepts data until the client\n        disconnects, at which time stdin is closed and remains closed until the\n        container is restarted. If this flag is false, a container processes that\n        reads from stdin will never receive an EOF. Default is false\n        \n      terminationMessagePath\t<string>\n        Optional: Path at which the file to which the container\'s termination\n        message will be written is mounted into the container\'s filesystem.

Cannot be updated.\n        \n      terminationMessagePolicy\t<string>\n        Indicate how the termination message should be populated. File will use the\n        contents of terminationMessagePath to populate the container status message\n        on both success and failure. FallbackToLogsOnError will use the last chunk\n        of container log output if the termination message file is empty and the\n        container exited with an error. The log output is limited to 2048 bytes or\n        80 lines, whichever is smaller. Defaults to File.

This may be extended in the\n    future if we require larger or smaller quantities.\n        \n    When a Quantity is parsed from a string, it will remember the type of suffix\n    it had, and will use the same type again when it is serialized.\n        \n    Before serializing, Quantity will be put in "canonical form". This means\n    that Exponent/suffix will be adjusted up or down (with a corresponding\n    increase or decrease in Mantissa) such that:\n        \n    - No precision is lost - No fractional digits will be emitted - The exponent\n    (or suffix) is as large as possible.\n        \n    The sign will be omitted unless the number is negative.\n        \n    Examples:\n        \n    - 1.5 will be serialized as "1500m" - 1.5Gi will be serialized as "1536Mi"\n        \n    Note that the quantity will NEVER be internally represented by a floating\n    point number. That is the whole point of this exercise.\n        \n    Non-canonical values will still parse as long as they are well formed, but\n    will be re-emitted in their canonical form. (So always use canonical form,\n    or don\'t diff.)\n        \n    This format is intended to make it difficult to use these numbers without\n    writing some sort of special handling code in the hopes that that will cause\n    implementors to also use a fixed point implementation.\n\n',

A null or empty list means only match against\n        labelSelector.\n            \n        This is a beta field and requires the MatchLabelKeysInPodTopologySpread\n        feature gate to be enabled (enabled by default).\n        \n      maxSkew\t<integer> -required-\n        MaxSkew describes the degree to which pods may be unevenly distributed. When\n        `whenUnsatisfiable=DoNotSchedule`, it is the maximum permitted difference\n        between the number of matching pods in the target topology and the global\n        minimum. The global minimum is the minimum number of matching pods in an\n        eligible domain or zero if the number of eligible domains is less than\n        MinDomains. For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods\n        with the same labelSelector spread as 2/2/1: In this case, the global\n        minimum is 1. | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 | |  P P  |  P P  |   P   | - if\n        MaxSkew is 1, incoming pod can only be scheduled to zone3 to become 2/2/2;\n        scheduling it onto zone1(zone2) would make the ActualSkew(3-1) on\n        zone1(zone2) violate MaxSkew(1). - if MaxSkew is 2, incoming pod can be\n        scheduled onto any zone. When `whenUnsatisfiable=ScheduleAnyway`, it is used\n        to give higher precedence to topologies that satisfy it. It\'s a required\n        field. Default value is 1 and 0 is not allowed.\n        \n      minDomains\t<integer>\n        MinDomains indicates a minimum number of eligible domains. When the number\n        of eligible domains with matching topology keys is less than minDomains, Pod\n        Topology Spread treats "global minimum" as 0, and then the calculation of\n        Skew is performed. And when the number of eligible domains with matching\n        topology keys equals or greater than minDomains, this value has no effect on\n        scheduling. As a result, when the number of eligible domains is less than\n        minDomains, scheduler won\'t schedule more than maxSkew Pods to those\n        domains. If value is nil, the constraint behaves as if MinDomains is equal\n        to 1. Valid values are integers greater than 0. When value is not nil,\n        WhenUnsatisfiable must be DoNotSchedule.\n            \n        For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 2, MinDomains is set to\n        5 and pods with the same labelSelector spread as 2/2/2: | zone1 | zone2 |\n        zone3 | |  P P  |  P P  |  P P  | The number of domains is less than\n        5(MinDomains), so "global minimum" is treated as 0. In this situation, new\n        pod with the same labelSelector cannot be scheduled, because computed skew\n        will be 3(3 - 0) if new Pod is scheduled to any of the three zones, it will\n        violate MaxSkew.\n            \n        This is a beta field and requires the MinDomainsInPodTopologySpread feature\n        gate to be enabled (enabled by default).\n        \n      nodeAffinityPolicy\t<string>\n        NodeAffinityPolicy indicates how we will treat Pod\'s\n        nodeAffinity/nodeSelector when calculating pod topology spread skew.
