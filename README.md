# openshift-python-wrapper (`wrapper`)

Pypi: [openshift-python-wrapper](https://pypi.org/project/openshift-python-wrapper)  
A python wrapper for [kubernetes-python-client](https://github.com/kubernetes-client/python) with support for [RedHat Container Virtualization](https://www.openshift.com/learn/topics/virtualization)  
Docs: [openshift-python-wrapper docs](https://openshift-python-wrapper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

The wrapper offers a simple and intuitive interface for interacting with the API.  
It standardizes how to work with cluster resources and offers unified resource CRUD (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) flows.  
The wrapper also provides additional capabilities, such as resource-specific functionality that otherwise needs to be implemented by users.  
The wrapper makes code easier to read and maintain over time.

One example of simplified usage is interacting with a container.  
Running a command inside a container requires using Kubernetes stream, handling errors, and more.  
The wrapper handles it all and provides simple and intuitive functionality.

Both developers or testers can use the wrapper. The code is modular and easy to maintain.  
Instead of writing custom code for every API, you can use the wrapper that provides a consistent interface for interacting with APIs.  
It saves time, avoids code duplications, and reduces the chance of errors.

Using Python capabilities, context managers can provide out-of-the-box resource creation and deletion,  
and inheritance can be used to extend functionality for specific use cases.  
Pytest fixtures can utilize the code for setup and teardown, leaving no leftovers.  
Resources can even be saved for debugging.  
Resource manifests and logs can be easily collected.

## Installation

From source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/RedHatQE/openshift-python-wrapper.git
cd openshift-python-wrapper
uv sync
```

To use the wrapper in another project:

```bash
uv pip install /path/to/openshift-python-wrapper
```

From Pypi:

```bash
uv pip install openshift-python-wrapper
```

## Fake Kubernetes Client

The project includes a comprehensive fake Kubernetes client for testing without a real cluster. See [Fake Kubernetes Client documentation](fake_kubernetes_client/README.md) for details.

## MCP Server

The project includes an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that exposes OpenShift/Kubernetes functionality through a standardized interface. See [MCP Server documentation](mcp_server/README.md) for details.

## Release new version

### requirements

- Export GitHub token

```bash
export GITHUB_TOKEN=<your_github_token>
```

- [release-it](https://github.com/release-it/release-it)

```bash
sudo npm install --global release-it
npm install --save-dev @release-it/bumper
```

### usage

- Create a release, run from the relevant branch.  
  To create a 4.11 release, run:

```bash
git checkout v4.11
git pull
release-it # Follow the instructions
```

## docs

Hosted on readthedocs.io [openshift-python-wrapper](https://openshift-python-wrapper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

## PR dependency

For PR dependency we use [dpulls](https://www.dpulls.com/)  
To make PR depends on other PR add `depends on #<PR NUMBER>` in the PR description.

## Logging configuration

To change log level export OPENSHIFT_PYTHON_WRAPPER_LOG_LEVEL:

```bash
export OPENSHIFT_PYTHON_WRAPPER_LOG_LEVEL=<LOG_LEVEL> # can be: "DEBUG", "INFO", "WARNING", "ERROR", "CRITICAL"
```

- By default some sensitive information is hashed in the logs, and if running with DEBUG the log output can be corrupted.  
  In secure environments user can set `OPENSHIFT_PYTHON_WRAPPER_HASH_LOG_DATA="false"` environment variable to disable the log hashing.

  ```bash
  export OPENSHIFT_PYTHON_WRAPPER_HASH_LOG_DATA="false"
  ```

## Proxy Enablement

This configuration allows the client to route traffic through a specified proxy server.

To enable proxy configuration for the client:

1. Define either `HTTPS_PROXY` or `HTTP_PROXY` environment variable with your proxy URL:

```bash
export HTTPS_PROXY="http://proxy.example.com:8080"
# or
export HTTP_PROXY="http://proxy.example.com:8080"
```

## Code check

We use [prek](https://github.com/j178/prek) for code check.

```bash
prek install
```

Some code examples locate at [examples](examples) directory

## Adding Tests for New Resources

### Add tests

Generate automated tests for newly added resources using the test generator:

**Note**: Tests are only generated for classes that were generated by class-generator.

```bash
# Generate tests for a specific resource
uv run tests/scripts/generate_pytest_test.py --kind ResourceName

# Generate tests for multiple resources
uv run tests/scripts/generate_pytest_test.py --kind Pod,Service,Deployment

# Preview generated tests without writing files
uv run tests/scripts/generate_pytest_test.py --kind ResourceName --dry-run
```

The generator creates standard CRUD tests in `tests/test_resources/test_resource_name.py` using the fake client for isolated testing without requiring a real Kubernetes cluster.

Run the generated tests:

```bash
# Run tests for specific resource
uv run --group tests pytest tests/test_resources/test_resource_name.py

# Run all resource tests
uv run --group tests pytest tests/test_resources/
```
