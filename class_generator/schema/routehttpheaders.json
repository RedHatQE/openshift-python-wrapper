      "description": "actions specifies options for modifying headers and their values. Note that this option only applies to cleartext HTTP connections and to secure HTTP connections for which the ingress controller terminates encryption (that is, edge-terminated or reencrypt connections).  Headers cannot be modified for TLS passthrough connections. Setting the HSTS (`Strict-Transport-Security`) header is not supported via actions. `Strict-Transport-Security` may only be configured using the \"haproxy.router.openshift.io/hsts_header\" route annotation, and only in accordance with the policy specified in Ingress.Spec.RequiredHSTSPolicies. In case of HTTP request headers, the actions specified in spec.httpHeaders.actions on the Route will be executed after the actions specified in the IngressController's spec.httpHeaders.actions field. In case of HTTP response headers, the actions specified in spec.httpHeaders.actions on the IngressController will be executed after the actions specified in the Route's spec.httpHeaders.actions field. The headers set via this API will not appear in access logs. Any actions defined here are applied after any actions related to the following other fields: cache-control, spec.clientTLS, spec.httpHeaders.forwardedHeaderPolicy, spec.httpHeaders.uniqueId, and spec.httpHeaders.headerNameCaseAdjustments. The following header names are reserved and may not be modified via this API: Strict-Transport-Security, Proxy, Cookie, Set-Cookie. Note that the total size of all net added headers *after* interpolating dynamic values must not exceed the value of spec.tuningOptions.headerBufferMaxRewriteBytes on the IngressController. Please refer to the documentation for that API field for more details.",
