Because secret storage is out-of-cluster, updates to it are not registered by the controllers. This CRD serves as a \"trigger\" for reconciliation of the SPIAccessToken or RemoteSecret after the data has been updated in the secret storage. The caller that updates the data in the secret storage is responsible for creating an object pointing to the SPIAccessToken or RemoteSecret that should have been affected.",
