Namespaces having project-wide node selectors won't be\nimpacted even if this field is set. This adds an annotation section to\nthe namespace.\nFor example, if a new namespace is created with\nnode-selector='type=user-node,region=east',\nthe annotation openshift.io/node-selector: type=user-node,region=east\ngets added to the project. When the openshift.io/node-selector annotation\nis set on the project the value is used in preference to the value we are setting\nfor defaultNodeSelector field.\nFor instance,\nopenshift.io/node-selector: \"type=user-node,region=west\" means\nthat the default of \"type=user-node,region=east\" set in defaultNodeSelector\nwould not be applied.",
