  "description": "CloudPrivateIPConfig performs an assignment of a private IP address to the\nprimary NIC associated with cloud VMs. This is done by specifying the IP and\nKubernetes node which the IP should be assigned to. This CRD is intended to\nbe used by the network plugin which manages the cluster network. The spec\nside represents the desired state requested by the network plugin, and the\nstatus side represents the current state that this CRD's controller has\nexecuted. No users will have permission to modify it, and if a cluster-admin\ndecides to edit it for some reason, their changes will be overwritten the\nnext time the network plugin reconciles the object. Note: the CR's name\nmust specify the requested private IP address (can be IPv4 or IPv6).\n\nCompatibility level 1: Stable within a major release for a minimum of 12 months or 3 minor releases (whichever is longer).",
