        Args:
            description (str): Description is a user-facing description of the pipeline that may be
              used to populate a UI.

            display_name (str): DisplayName is a user-facing name of the pipeline that may be used to
              populate a UI.

            finally_ (list[Any]): Finally declares the list of Tasks that execute just before leaving
              the Pipeline i.e. either after all Tasks are finished executing
              successfully or after a failure which would result in ending the
              Pipeline

                Note: Parameter renamed from &#39;finally&#39; to avoid Python keyword conflict.
            params (list[Any]): Params declares a list of input parameters that must be supplied when
              this Pipeline is run.

            results (list[Any]): Results are values that this pipeline can output once run

            tasks (list[Any]): Tasks declares the graph of Tasks that execute when this Pipeline is
              run.

            workspaces (list[Any]): Workspaces declares a set of named workspaces that are expected to be
              provided by a PipelineRun.
