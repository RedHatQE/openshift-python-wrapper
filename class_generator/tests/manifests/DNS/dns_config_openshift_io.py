            base_domain (str): baseDomain is the base domain of the cluster. All managed DNS records
              will be sub-domains of this base.  For example, given the base
              domain `openshift.example.com`, an API server DNS record may be
              created for `cluster-api.openshift.example.com`.  Once set, this
              field cannot be changed.

            platform (dict[str, Any]): platform holds configuration specific to the underlying infrastructure
              provider for DNS. When omitted, this means the user has no opinion
              and the platform is left to choose reasonable defaults. These
              defaults are subject to change over time.

            private_zone (dict[str, Any]): privateZone is the location where all the DNS records that are only
              available internally to the cluster exist.  If this field is nil,
              no private records should be created.  Once set, this field cannot
              be changed.

            public_zone (dict[str, Any]): publicZone is the location where all the DNS records that are publicly
              accessible to the internet exist.  If this field is nil, no public
              records should be created.  Once set, this field cannot be
              changed.
