Each key must consist of alphanumeric\n    characters, '-', '_' or '.'. BinaryData can contain byte sequences that are\n    not in the UTF-8 range. The keys stored in BinaryData must not overlap with\n    the ones in the Data field, this is enforced during validation process.\n    Using this field will require 1.10+ apiserver and kubelet.\n\n  data\t<map[string]string>\n    Data contains the configuration data.
