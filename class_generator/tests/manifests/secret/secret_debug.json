The total bytes of the values in\n    the Data field must be less than MaxSecretSize bytes.\n    \nFIELDS:\n  apiVersion\t<string>\n    APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an object.\n    Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal value, and\n    may reject unrecognized values. More info:\n    https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#resources\n\n  data\t<map[string]string>\n    Data contains the secret data. Each key must consist of alphanumeric\n    characters, '-', '_' or '.'. The serialized form of the secret data is a\n    base64 encoded string, representing the arbitrary (possibly non-string) data\n    value here. Described in https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4648#section-4\n\n  immutable\t<boolean>\n    Immutable, if set to true, ensures that data stored in the Secret cannot be\n    updated (only object metadata can be modified). If not set to true, the\n    field can be modified at any time. Defaulted to nil.\n\n  kind\t<string>\n    Kind is a string value representing the REST resource this object\n    represents. Servers may infer this from the endpoint the client submits\n    requests to. Cannot be updated. In CamelCase. More info:\n    https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#types-kinds\n\n  metadata\t<ObjectMeta>\n    Standard object's metadata. More info:\n    https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#metadata\n\n  stringData\t<map[string]string>\n    stringData allows specifying non-binary secret data in string form. It is\n    provided as a write-only input field for convenience. All keys and values\n    are merged into the data field on write, overwriting any existing values.\n    The stringData field is never output when reading from the API.\n\n  type\t<string>\n    Used to facilitate programmatic handling of secret data.
